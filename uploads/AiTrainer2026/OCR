# CODE BLOCK 6: Reading a Full Sentence (OCR)
# Note: This uses a pre-trained model because reading lines requires 
# complex "Sequence" models (CRNNs), not just simple "Classifiers".

# 1. Install the library (this takes about 30 seconds)

import easyocr
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 2. Initialize the Reader (We tell it to look for English 'en')
# The first time you run this, it will download the detection model.
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en']) 

# 3. Define the file you uploaded
image_path = 'my_handwriting.jpg'

# 4. Read the text
# detail=0 means "just give me the text", don't give me the math coordinates
results = reader.readtext(image_path, detail=0)

# 5. Show the Image
img = cv2.imread(image_path)
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

# 6. Print what the AI found
print("\n--- AI READS ---")
for line in results:
    print(line)
